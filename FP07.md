See [fp07Calibration](fp07Calibration.m) for the code.

For each FP07 sensor:
- Extract all the profiles JAC_T and FP07 data
- For each profile take the cross correlation to find the maximum correlation and the lag between the sensors.
- Find a weighted median lag between the sensors for the whole file.
- Fit the JAC_T and FP07 data from all the profiles.
- Compute the FP07 derived temperatures from the fit and replace the T?_(slow|fast) values.

For all the sensors compute the median weighted lag.
Shift JAC_T and JAC_C by the lag so they are time aligned with the FP07 sensors.
